# FinalProject-By-Himanshu-Yati-Aditi-Rohit
Data Visualization Final Project

One data-set was quite large in size so Github did not allow to push it. Please download that data-set from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-M8HN6ZvMgTD-TFTTtf-f2E7u6eLccIX/view?usp=sharing) and copy it in the data-sets folder and then run the Jupyter Notebook.


**Title:** Ripple Effect - Choose Your Food Wisely

**Team:** Himanshu Kohli, Yati Agrawal, Aditi Awasthy, and Rohit Khattar

**Abstract:** Climate change theory has been debunked by many, but we have data that proves its existence and the momentous 
effects of the change. Although national governments have been working tediously to combat the effects of 
climate change and spread awareness about the same, more light must be shed on the true causes of climate change. 
Data shows that humans at the individual level can make a huge impact on climate change by choosing their 
food wisely.
